# TDLAS mapping
Algorithms for generating a gas concentration map from integral TDLAS measurements through non-linear optimization.

Example launch files for the data-gathering process can be found at [https://github.com/MAPIRlab/missions/tree/ros2/launch/methane](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/missions/tree/ros2/launch/methane)

The hardware drivers for the tools used in those experiments can be found at [https://github.com/MAPIRlab/hw_drivers](https://github.com/MAPIRlab/hw_drivers)

A video of the experiments can be found [here](Experiment_hunter.mp4).
